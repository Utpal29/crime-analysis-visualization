# crime-analysis-visualization

This project analyzes the Chicago Crime dataset (2001–2022) using data visualization and a Decision Tree Classifier
to predict arrest likelihood. It was completed as part of the Data Visualization course (CSE3020) at VIT University.

## 🧠 Summary
- **Dataset:** Chicago Crime dataset (7M+ entries)
- **Tech:** Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn)
- **Goal:** Identify crime trends and predict arrest types using a Decision Tree model.
- **Faculty Guide:** Prof. Jyotismita Chaki

## 📊 Highlights
- Trend analysis by year, month, day, and location
- Visualization of high-crime zones using scatter and 3D plots
- Classification of true vs. false arrests using Decision Tree Classifier
- Achieved accuracy validated via cross-validation
